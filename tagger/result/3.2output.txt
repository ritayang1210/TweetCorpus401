We can see that we are right now achieving the best accuracy with size 7000 or 3500 per class. With size either greater or smaller than 7000, we are having decline in the accuracy. Usually, we would expect that the accuracy increases as data size increases since it could cover more possible cases in each class and lower the effect of outliers. Therefore it makes sense that we are having better performance for size 7000 than smaller. However, it's unusual that the accuracy is decreasing once we have data size greater 7000. It could be that the proportion of outliers and noise is considerably larger in the last part of the data. Also, since we are using decision tree model here, it's quite possible we are having overfitting issue which reduces the training set error at the cost of an decreased test set error.
