We notice that SecondPersonPronouns, Past-tenseVerbs and Adverbs are of the same importance at both low and high amounts of input data. We also notice that FirstPersonPronouns and AvgLengthOfTokens are of similar importance as they just switched their ranking as top and second. FirstPersonPronouns, SecondPersonPronouns, Past-tenseVerbs and Adverbs seem to be the most important properties of english sentences. Their importance is so obvious that we can still tell even if the data size is small because almost all english sentences will contain them. AvgLengthOfTokens are of similar importance because it's not sensitive to data size. Even if we just have 10 sentences, we can still calculate the AvgLengthOfTokens and we will still probably conclude with same importance rank for it.
